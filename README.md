Introduction

With a cleaned version of the original Nutrition data, which is sourced from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the analysis focuses on nutrient information of around nine thousand food items. The objectives include four main parts: Data Cleaning, Imputation, Preprocessing, and Predictive Modeling. Selected predictors undergo imputation, preprocessing, and outlier detection, paving the way for various classification techniques like KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The report concludes by prescribing the best-performing model for predicting a binary calorie response variable, offering insights for informed decision-making in food nutrition labeling.
